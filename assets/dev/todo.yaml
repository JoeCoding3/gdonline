    [WIP] My recreation of GD, online
todo:
    add jump pads to play Back on Track (called 'bump's in sprites)

    add coin counter in top right corner
    make player hitbox smaller:
        (can go through 1 block gap)
        use playerW to calculate landing on blocks so icon doesn't clip through
        add var for player hitbox width
    editor:
        prevent player from going before start of level
        when loading level from array:
            find way to reload this on player death instead of from file
        make coins respawn when entering:
            disappear again when exit
    add error handling:
        make custom error classes in errors.js
    add actual buttons, in addition to keyboard keys/mouse buttons
