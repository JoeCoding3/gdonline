    [WIP] My recreation of GD, online
todo:
    add ceiling after ship portal:
        remove after cube portal
        look at level "back on track" for ceiling height
    add vertical camera movement:
        figure out how real gd handles this
    
    add error handling:
        make custom error classes in errors.js
        add console logging/warning/debugging for lots of things
    add actual buttons, in addition to keyboard keys/mouse buttons
    try remaking using classes
    add music:
        code already in importgd.js
        use levelSongID for song id, levelOfficialSong and levelCustomSong to check if song is official/custom
        check gdbrowser video/api to get url and parameters to download song from robtop's servers
        sync game to real gd speed:
            try playerSpdX=10
            need to change gravity, jump height, jump pad strength, ground object repeat offset, etc. to account for faster speed
        make fps more stable so music can sync
    add version system:
        maybe the first version is the first public release
