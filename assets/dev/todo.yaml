    [WIP] My recreation of GD, online
todo:
    editor:
        figure out how https://gdcolon.com/gdsave/ decrypts save file
        when loading level from array:
            find way to reload this on player death instead of from file
        make coins respawn when entering:
            disappear again when exit
    add error handling:
        make custom error classes in errors.js
    add actual buttons, in addition to keyboard keys/mouse buttons
