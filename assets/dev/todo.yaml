    [WIP] My recreation of GD, online
todo:
    add length rating to levels:
        lengths (seconds):
            tiny: 1-10
            short: 11-30
            medium: 31-60
            long: 61-120
            xl: 121+
        tiny/short/meduim/long/xl:
            abbreviate to t/s/m/l/x
        put on let of progress bar
        center progress bar
        move percent counter to right of progress bar
    
    add ceiling after ship portal:
        remove after cube portal
    
    add error handling:
        make custom error classes in errors.js
        add console logging/warning/debugging for lots of things
    add actual buttons, in addition to keyboard keys/mouse buttons
    try remaking using classes
    add music:
        sync game to real gd speed:
            try playerSpdX=10
            need to change gravity, jump height, jump pad strength, ground object repeat offset, etc. to account for faster speed
        make fps more stable so music can sync
