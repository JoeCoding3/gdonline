    [WIP] My recreation of GD, online
todo:
    use idb to remember file handles for levels and save directories:
        user only selects folders once
    add ceiling after ship portal:
        remove after cube portal
    editor:
        prevent player from going before start of level
        when loading level from array:
            find way to reload this on player death instead of from file
        make coins respawn when entering:
            disappear again when exit
    add error handling:
        make custom error classes in errors.js
    add actual buttons, in addition to keyboard keys/mouse buttons
    try remaking using classes
