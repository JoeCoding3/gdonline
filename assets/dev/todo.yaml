    [WIP] My recreation of GD, online
todo:
    add jump pads to play Back on Track (called 'bump' in sprites)

    get jack's permission to put his name in the devs list
    make level files stored as .level.txt not .level.js:
        (bypasses uncommen file popup)
        not sure if necessary, but might need to use <script type="text/javascript"></script>
    ship gamemode:
        improve physics:
            make fall/fly faster
        fix infinite rotation glitch
        prevent crashing from head collision
    editor:
        prevent player from going before start of level
        when loading level from array:
            find way to reload this on player death instead of from file
        make coins respawn when entering:
            disappear again when exit
    add error handling:
        make custom error classes in errors.js
    add actual buttons, in addition to keyboard keys/mouse buttons
