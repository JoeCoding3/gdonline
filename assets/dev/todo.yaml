todo:
    tweak ship physics:
        do it myself or let jack do it
    editor:
        add level importing:
            get level data from real gd:
                filter to map from normal gd objects to my limited set and type

        make custom error classes in errors.js
    add credits and a disclaimer that this isn't real gd
