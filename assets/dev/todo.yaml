    [WIP] My recreation of GD, online
todo:
    add ceiling after ship portal:
        remove after cube portal
    add 90-degree rotation:
        hold shift while clicking/right-clicking to add 90 degrees
    when loading level from save file:
        set block properties to include gridX and gridY to allow removing off-grid blocks in editor
        maybe? but can't re-place though...
    editor:
        prevent player from going before start of level
        when loading level from array:
            find way to reload this on player death instead of from file
        make coins respawn when entering:
            disappear again when exit
    add error handling:
        make custom error classes in errors.js
    add actual buttons, in addition to keyboard keys/mouse buttons
