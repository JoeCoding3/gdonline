Level Exporting:
    Level will auto-export when exiting editor mode, this is the small freeze that you may notice.
    When exporting:
        Input the name of the level and click OK.
        Input the level description and click OK, or just click Cancel.
        To cancel exporting, click Cancel.
        Save the level file in gdonline/assets/level/levels.
        The level will download with a .js extension, don't change it.
        You can rename the file to change the level name.
Importing from real GD:
    This allows you to import your saved levels.
    To import official levels, I would recommend cloning levels from the GD account RobsVault.
    Every time you change your custom levels in real GD, and before using this feature:
        Go to C:\Users\[NAME]\AppData\Local\GeometryDash (replace [NAME] with your username).
        Copy CCLocalLevels.dat to gdonline/assets/level/save.
    When Importing:
        Select gdonline/assets/levell/save/CCLocalLevels.dat.
        Enter the index of the level you want to load.
Config:
    File is gdonline/assets/options.js.
    Options:
        targetFps: Target game speed
        levelName: Name of the level to load on startup
        showHitboxes: Show hitboxes or not
        showStatus: Show game status or not (play/pause/editor)
        showFps: Show fps or not
Cursor:
    Invisible while playing.
    Default when paused.
    Pointer when editing.
Misc:
    You can only place 3 coins per level.
Notes:
    Does not need to be run on a server.
    FPS counter and game status indicator in top left corner.
    Enjoy!
