Level Exporting:
    Level will auto-export when exiting editor mode, this is the small freeze that you may notice.
    When exporting:
        Input the name of the level and click OK.
        To cancel exporting, click Cancel.
        Save the level file in gdonline/assets/level/levels.
        The level will download with a .js extension, don't change it.
        You can rename the file to change the level name.
Importing from real GD:
    This allows you to import your saved levels.
    To import official levels, I would recommend cloning levels from the account RobsVault.
    Every time you change your custom levels in real GD, and before using this feature:
        Go to C:\Users\[NAME]\AppData\Local\GeometryDash (replace [NAME] with your username).
        Copy CCLocalLevels.dat to gdonline/assets/level/save.
    When Importing:
        Select gdonline/assets/levell/save/CCLocalLevels.dat.
        Enter the index of the level you want to load.
Config:
    File is gdonline/assets/options.js.
    Options:
        targetFps: Target game speed
        showHitboxes: Draw hitboxes or not
        levelName: Name of the level to load on startup

    Invisible while playing.
    Default when paused.
    Pointer when editing.

    Enjoy!
