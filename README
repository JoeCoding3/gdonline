Level Exporting:
    Level will auto-export when exiting editor mode, this is the small freeze that you may notice.
    When exporting:
        Input the name of the level and click OK.
        Input the level description and click OK, or just click Cancel.
        To cancel exporting, click Cancel.
        Save the level file in gdonline/assets/level/levels.
        You can rename the file to change the level name, but don't change the extension.
Importing from real Geometry Dash:
    This allows you to import your saved levels (not official levels).
    Every time you change your custom levels in real Geometry Dash, and before using this feature:
        Go to C:\Users\[NAME]\AppData\Local\GeometryDash (replace [NAME] with your computer username).
        Copy CCLocalLevels.dat to gdonline/assets/level/save.
    When importing:
        Select gdonline/assets/levell/save/CCLocalLevels.dat.
        Enter the index of the level you want to load.
Config:
    File is gdonline/assets/options.js.
    Options:
        targetFps: Target game speed
        levelName: Name of the level to load on startup
        showHitboxes: Show hitboxes or not
        showStatus: Show game status or not (play/pause/editor)
        showFps: Show fps or not
Notes:
    Does not need to be run on a server.
